# TESTNET 3 CHALLENGES

After two successful testnets in 2020 and our mainnet launch within sight, we are happy to announce the launch of Concordium Testnet 3 and to invite testers, developers, and users all over the world to compete to earn up to 1 million GTU. 

## Rationale

Concordium Testnet 3 is a collaborative era intended to stress-test the network, encourage participation from all over the world, and help testers, developers, and users get ready to participate in Concordium. 

Concordium Testnet 3 will be released on Oct. the 6th, 2020.
The Incentivized Testnet 3 will be launched on Oct. the 15th 2020 and will end 6 weeks later.  

During this period, node operators, developers, and community members can receive rewards (up to 0,1% of the mainnet supply, meaning 1,000,000 GTU) for helping to secure, sustain, and grow Concordium Network and the ecosystem. 


## Rules of Engagement
Concordium does not intend to collect and store any other user data of its challenge contributors than what is strictly necessary to pay out their rewards on the mainnet once it is launch. Concordium only stores the GitHub user name and the earned total reward amount of its contributors.

The following rules of engagements are required:

- A contributor, who wants to submit a challenge result in repository Testnet3-Challenges, must be a registered user on GitHub.
- All submissions must be signed with GitHub build-in commit signature meachanism using GPG.
- The GitHub user name should not be changed until the rewards are paid out
- After the launch of the mainnet, a contributor should create a mainnet account and send a signed submission of the account address in repository Testnet3-RewardClaim.

To sign your submissions, you must use the GitHub build-in commit signature meachanism using GPG. If a commit has a signature that cannot be verified by GitHub, i.e. marked unverified or not marked at all, it does not constitute a valid submission for Concordium. Please see [GitHub - Commit Signature](docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification) for more information.

**This approach enables Concordium to trace the GitHub user name to earned rewards on Testnet3-Challenges and to a mainnet account on Testnet3-RewardClaim.** 

Note that in one challenge, i.e. challenge (ID2) in mission Identities, a contributor must use a valid real-life identity to issue a Concordium identity. Concordium will only check the identity attributes made public in the submission. The Concordium identity will be erased when testnet3 is taken down.

## Mission and Challenges
The challenges can be viewed in [Project Challenges](https://github.com/Concordium/Testnet3-Challenges/projects/1).

## Reward distribution
- Concordium accepts one approved submission per challenge per contributor. 
- Each challenge has a GTU amount tag, which is rewarded, if Concordium approves the submission.
- Rejected submissions can be modified and resubmitted.
- Each mission has a max total reward. Rewards are paid out after the first-come-first-serve principal. When the max total reward is reached, Concordium will close the respective challenges and wonâ€™t approve any more related submissions.

## Submission Process
- [Fork a repo.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
- Navigate to the relevant subfolder in the respective mission folder.
- [Create or upload your submission content.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/managing-files-on-github)
- [Make a signed commit.](docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification)
- [Create a pull request.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests)
- Concordium approves correct and signed submissions and merges them to the main branch on the initial repo.
